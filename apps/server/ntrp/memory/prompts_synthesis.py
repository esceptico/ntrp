"""LLM synthesis prompts for memory pages.

Three prose-page synthesizers that replace the bullet-dump projection. Each
receives a list of atomic RECORDS (id, text, kind, labels, pinned,
last_confirmed_at) and synthesizes a grounded markdown page FROM them.

Modeled on dex's context-wiki: durable, texture-rich, no slop. The key ntrp
difference: input is atomic records with stable ids, so provenance is an inline
`(record:XXXXXXXX)` tag carrying the 8-char id prefix of the supporting record —
not a `(from slack)`-style source tag. The model may cite ONLY the ids it was
given, and may assert ONLY what those records support.

  - PROFILE_SYSTEM     -> me.md
  - DOSSIER_SYSTEM     -> topics/<subject>.md  (one page per subject)
  - ACTIVE_WORK_SYSTEM -> active-work.md

Record kinds (ntrp.memory.models.Kind): directive | fact | source | changelog.
Scopes are visibility metadata, not shown to the model.

<grounding>
You are given a fixed set of atomic RECORDS. Each line begins with an 8-char id
in brackets, e.g. `[3f2a1b9c]`. That id is your only currency.

- Every non-obvious claim ends with an inline provenance tag naming the
  record(s) that support it: `(record:3f2a1b9c)`. Two or more supports combine:
  `(record:3f2a1b9c, record:7d1e0a44)`.
- Use ONLY ids that appear in the records below. Never invent, guess, or
  reformat an id. If you cannot point to a real id, do not make the claim.
- Assert ONLY what the records support. Do not import outside knowledge, fill
  gaps with plausible detail, or infer facts the records don't state. If the
  records don't say it, it isn't on the page.
- A `directive` record is a standing instruction from the user — it always wins
  over an inferred pattern. A `fact` is a stable truth about the user or their
  world. A `source` is a receipt/pointer; cite it for the fact it evidences, not
  as a fact of its own. Ignore `changelog` records — they are housekeeping.
- A `pinned` record is user-blessed; never omit or contradict it.
- An `integration-sourced` record was machine-extracted from an external system
  (calendar/email/slack), not stated by the user. Cite it, but phrase the claim
  tentatively ("appears to", "as of last sync") — it is evidence, not a confirmed
  user fact.
- When two records conflict, prefer the one confirmed more recently and the
  higher-authority kind (directive > fact > source). State the current truth;
  do not narrate the contradiction.
</grounding>"""

_NO_SLOP = """\
<output_rules>
Write tight, concrete prose. No preamble, no filler, no hedging on cited facts.

Banned:
- "It's worth noting that...", "Interestingly...", "Notably...", "Overall..."
- "Based on the available records...", "From what I can see...", "It appears..."
- "I've synthesized...", "Here is the...", "Let me...", restating the task
- Generic padding: "is involved in various initiatives", "plays a key role"
- Any claim with no `(record:...)` tag that isn't trivially obvious (section
  headers, the user's own name)

Output ONLY the markdown page. No code fences around it, no commentary before
or after. Short paragraphs over walls of text. If a section has nothing
record-backed to say, omit the section entirely — an absent section beats a
padded one.

Preserve the user's own phrasing when a record quotes them directly; don't
paraphrase a stated preference into blandness.

_SYNTHESIS_QUALITY = """\
<synthesis_quality>
SYNTHESIZE, don't enumerate. The failure mode you are replacing is a bullet
dump: "The user prefers tea. The user imports Apple Health into Obsidian." Your
job is the opposite — fold related records into coherent prose that reads like
an operational briefing.

- Group records by what they're ABOUT, then write a paragraph per theme that
  integrates them. Several records about the same thing become one sentence with
  several citations, not several sentences.
- Keep it durable and timeless-but-current: write what is TRUE NOW, not a diary
  of what happened. "Owns the memory subsystem (record:...)" not "On Tuesday
  added a record about memory."
- Texture is the value. Prefer the specific ("reviews PRs before merge, no
  auto-commit") over the generic ("cares about quality").
- Don't repeat the same fact in two sections. State it once, in the section
  where it belongs.
- A single uncorroborated inference is weak evidence — phrase it tentatively or
  leave it out. A directive or pinned record is strong — state it plainly.

Every other page is grounded in this one. It is an always-current briefing on
who the user is, how they work, and what they care about — not a timeline.

You are given the records that define the user: their standing `directive`s
(behavior rules they've set), their user-scoped `fact`s (identity, role,
preferences, background), and any `pinned` records (user-blessed, never drop).

user directly ("You work on…", "You prefer…"), never third-person narrator.

Output this structure, omitting any section with no record-backed content:

```
# <user's name, or "Profile" if no record names them>

## Identity
Role, company, contact handles, location/timezone, self-description — whatever
the records establish. Prose or tight bullets; cite each non-obvious claim.

## What you work on
The user's actual focus areas and ownership, synthesized into a few paragraphs
or a short list of substantive threads. Group related facts; cite them.

## Preferences
Standing behavior rules and stated preferences — how you want the assistant to
act, how you like to work. `directive` records anchor this section and are
stated as rules, not observations. Cite each.

## Key relationships / tools
The people you work with most closely and the tools/systems you rely on, each
with a one-line note on the relationship. Only those the records actually
establish; cite each.

You are also given `known_subjects`: the exact titles of topic pages that exist
elsewhere in the wiki. In `Key relationships / tools`, link ONLY those exact
titles with `[[Title]]`. If a person/tool/system is record-backed but not in
`known_subjects`, write it as plain text. Never imply a separate page exists for
a subject that has none.
