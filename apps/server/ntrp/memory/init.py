"""/init — full memory re-derivation driver.

Wipes every record EXCEPT pinned, resets the curator + consolidate watermarks,
re-derives memory from ALL chat transcripts through the worthiness curator, and
consolidates the resulting pile. Integration state lives in targeted feed
automations (feeds/), not in memory records — there is no ingest pass.

Order matters: backup first (P0), then a FAIL-FAST wipe (P1 — abort the whole
run if it raises, surfacing the backup path), then per-session transcript
re-derivation (P2, isolated so one bad session can't abort the rest), then
consolidation (P3). The `max_llm_calls` budget bounds transcript curation.
