"""Per-automation learnings sidecars — continual learning for the nightly maintenance
passes. A learnings file is a bounded, deduped, flat list of operational gotchas an
automation discovered: read at the START of a run (injected as orienting context),
appended after — so the passes stop running stateless every night. NO LLM here; read,
dedup, and cap are deterministic. Lives under <root>/.maintenance/ (excluded from the
record store, never injected into chat). Scoped to the dream pass for now — the only
maintenance pass that authors free text and can surface a genuine gotcha.
