"""~20-probe memory eval (research doc §11/§13: "a tiny eval keeps the knobs honest").

A 20-minute spot-check, NOT a gate: run real questions the user would ask against
the memory store and check recall surfaces the supporting record. Pass = any
expected substring appears in the top-k recall results. Runs against a COPY of the
live memory (never mutates the running server's dir).

    uv run python -m scripts.memory_eval            # against ~/.ntrp/memory (copied)
    uv run python -m scripts.memory_eval <dir>      # against another memory dir

Probes are user-specific by design — edit PROBES for your own memory. Lexical-only
here (no embedder attached); the live server's vector leg does better on paraphrase,
so a lexical FAIL flags either a real gap OR a paraphrase the vector leg would catch.
