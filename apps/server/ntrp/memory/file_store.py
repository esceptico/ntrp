"""FilePageStore — canonical memory backed by plain markdown pages, layered
Karpathy-style: the visible page file is compiled prose (the wiki), its
append-only record timeline lives in a raw/<same-path>.md sidecar.

Duck-types the slice of RecordStore that tools/profile/curator actually call
(open/close/attach_search_index, add/update/supersede_with/supersede/confirm/
set_pinned/delete, set_labels/labels_for/labels_of/list_labels, get/search/list/
count_active). Mounted under MEMORY_RECORDS_SERVICE in place of RecordStore so
canonicality flips with one assignment — no tool, prompt, or scope changes.

Retrieval is an in-memory token-overlap scan: at ~80 records this beats any index
(ponytail: no sqlite-vec, no FTS DB, no refresh-on-write bookkeeping). The .md
files are the single source of truth; nothing here is derived state to reconcile.
No git: durability is the files themselves + an external backup before destructive
passes.

# Memory conventions (AGENTS.md)

This directory is a personal memory wiki — plain markdown, the single source of
truth (no DB). An agent reads it to understand the user and act on their behalf.

## Layers (page = compiled prose; raw/ = record timeline)
Each visible page is **compiled prose** — the current, human-readable briefing.
Its append-only **timeline** of atomic records lives in `raw/<same-path>.md`:

    - 2026-06-21 ^a1b2c3d4 [fact] [imp:6] (src:curator) Tim rides a gravel bike.

A timeline line is the canonical record. Tags: `[pin]` (never dropped),
`[imp:1-10]` (poignancy), `[ent:slug]` (primary entity), `[superseded]`.
`(src:…)` is provenance. Never edit `raw/` by hand — it is machine-owned;
pages are compiled from it.

## Record kinds (by FUNCTION, not subject)
- `directive` — a standing behaviour rule the USER stated.
- `fact` — a stable, durable truth about the user or their world.
- `source` — a re-findable pointer (receipt), evidence for a fact.
- `lesson` — a working-pattern the agent DISTILLED (the continual-learning playbook).
- `changelog` — housekeeping; ignore for synthesis.

## Layout
- `me.md` — the user's profile (root of the wiki).
- `directives.md` — standing behaviour rules.   `lessons.md` — learned playbook.
- `active-work.md` — current work, synthesized across the store.
- `topics/<slug>.md` — one page per emergent subject (people, products, projects,
  topics). A subject emerges once it has ≥2 records (else parked on me.md); a page
  with a `scope_key` is a project workstream. No separate people/ or projects/ split.
- `references.md` — source pointers.
- `feeds/<slug>.md` — automation-owned briefings: a feed automation rewrites its page
  in place each run (memory_write). No records, no append log — the page IS the state.
- `insights/<month>.md` — cross-domain dream outputs (provisional, cited).
- `daily/<date>.md` — per-day activity log, synthesized prose only (browsable history).
- `health.md` — generated self-audit of gaps (stale topics, idle sources).
- `raw/<page-path>.md` — machine layer: the page's record timeline (never hand-edit).
- `.index/` — throwaway search index (rebuildable, never canonical).

Navigate by `index.md` — one line of meaning per page. Read it first, follow the
few relevant pages, and synthesize from those; don't load the whole vault.
`health.md` is the lint report: stale topics, orphans, pending synthesis, idle
sources. Both are regenerated on load and after synthesis.

## Source trust
When sources conflict, the higher-trust source wins — update the claim in place. A
lower-trust source never overrides a higher one. Integration- and dream-sourced claims
are phrased tentatively; never launder them into user-stated confidence.

| trust | source | how to treat it |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
{trust_rows}

## Grounding
Cite only real record ids you were given — never invent, reformat, or guess one. Assert
only what the cited records support; bring in no outside knowledge. On conflict between
records: directive > fact > source. Pinned records are never dropped; changelog records
are ignored for synthesis. Never leak a record id or file path into user-facing prose.
Cite dialects: synthesis passes emit `(record:<8hex>)`, which the store verifies and
then renders as a readable source tag — `(from chat)`, `(from gmail)`, `(inferred)` —
keeping the verified id list in the page's raw sidecar (`prose_cites`); dream insights
write `(because of ^id1, ^id2)`.

## Authoring
Re-read a page before editing it. Update prose IN PLACE — don't append corrections as new
sentences. Edit only the page prose, never the `raw/` timelines. Prune stale claims.
Two learnings channels — not parallel systems: `lessons.md` (the distilled, agent-facing
playbook) rides the resident profile into every turn; `.maintenance/<automation>-learnings.md`
holds per-automation operational notes read ONLY by that automation, never shown in chat.
