"""The sleep-time Dreamer — the background memory writer.

ONE LLM call per session: reads new transcript turns since a per-session
watermark, reconciles them against existing similar records (ADD/UPDATE/
SUPERSEDE/NOOP), and applies the ops — text AND labels — to the flat record
pool. Labels are open-vocabulary names (referents and categories) decided once
at write time; the prompt carries the existing vocabulary so names get reused
instead of re-minted. The chat path writes durable directives/facts/sources
through the worthiness gate; integration items bypass it via store_observations
(low-trust `observation` records the dream mines), since routine email/events
aren't durable facts but are the cross-domain texture the dream connects.

The watermark lives in a tiny `meta(key, value)` table the Dreamer OWNS inside
`config.memory_db_path`. Key form: `curate_watermark:{session_id}`. Anti-heartbeat:
a session with no new turns costs one DB read and no LLM call.

    "Rules:\n"
    "(1) ADMIT GATE / WORTHINESS — the bar is HIGH. Only mint durable, "
    "user-relevant knowledge: standing preferences, stable facts about the user "
    "or their world, behaviour rules, and real source pointers. DROP (admit "
    "NOTHING for) transient session recaps, catch-up/status narratives, "
    "tool-by-tool narration, and ntrp/Dex engineering or dev meta-commentary — "
    'rely on transcript search for those, not memory: return "records": []. '
    "Most exchanges contain NOTHING worth remembering. Operational/automation "
    "runs (the agent doing its job, SOPs, routine tool output) admit NOTHING "
    "unless they reveal durable user-level knowledge. Never turn one short task "
    "or debugging segment into a global fact or pattern. Explicit user "
    "corrections are maximal signal — always admit them, keep the user's wording.\n"
    "(1b) DIRECTIVE GATE — `directive` is the RAREST kind, reserved for a short, "
    "durable, user-STATED rule about how the assistant must behave (e.g. 'answer "
    "concisely', 'never commit without my review'). Keep it to 1-2 sentences. A "
    "context-specific instruction — about one codebase, tool, automation, "
    "migration, or workflow — is a `fact`, NOT a directive. NEVER promote a "
    "debugging fix, an implementation/SOP detail, a one-off task instruction, or a "
    "design opinion to a directive; those are facts or nothing. When unsure between "
    "directive and fact, choose fact.\n"
    "(2) Records are atomic, self-contained, short, and usable in future prompts (resolve pronouns inline), typed by "
    "FUNCTION not subject. Allowed kinds: directive (standing instruction), fact (stable durable statement), source (receipt pointer only). Choose the op against the EXISTING SIMILAR RECORDS: "
    "ADD (new), UPDATE (edit an existing one), SUPERSEDE (replace a now-wrong "
    "one), NOOP (reconfirm an unchanged one). Use ONLY ids that appear in "
    "EXISTING SIMILAR RECORDS; never invent an id.\n"
    "(3) LABELS — attach labels to every ADD/UPDATE/SUPERSEDE using two distinct fields:\n"
    "  entity_labels: 0-2 — the record's PRIMARY subject only: the specific person (Regina Lin), "
    "product (Dex, ntrp), company (Anthropic), project (MATS), or named concept (O-1A) the record is "
    "FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT. NOT subjects merely mentioned, listed as examples, or referenced in passing "
    "— a directive about ntrp memory design that says 'dossiers such as O-1A and health' is about "
    "ntrp/Memory design, NOT O-1A or health. A general rule/process with no single subject gets an "
    "EMPTY list. This drives dossier generation, so a stray label creates a junk subject page.\n"
    "  meta_labels: 0-3 category/workflow tags — Bug, Open loop, Health, Skills, Automation, "
    "etc. These classify the record but don't get their own dossiers.\n"
    "REUSE names from LABEL VOCABULARY whenever they fit, with exact casing; mint new ones only "
    "when nothing fits. UPDATE labels REPLACE the record's labels; omit both fields to keep them.\n"
    "(4) Never store assistant implementation reports, verification transcripts, migration summaries, or UI/file-path churn as memory. "
    "If the user corrects memory behavior, store only the durable behavior rule/preference, not a narrative of the fix. "
    "Never expose internal ids/provenance strings like project-proj_..., source=curator:..., facts/project-..., or summaries/project-... in record text. "
    "Write record text as clean human prose: keep meaningful names (people, products, experiment/metric names) but omit raw absolute file paths, commit hashes, UUIDs, and opaque run/tool ids — they are noise the projection now renders verbatim.\n"
    "(5) Output ONLY the JSON object, no preamble."
