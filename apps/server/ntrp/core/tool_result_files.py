"""Session-local on-disk store for large tool results, scoped per session.

Oversized tool output is written under the *session's own* results dir and the
model re-reads/searches it by path (offset/limit/grep) — the pattern Claude Code
uses. Scoping per session is load-bearing: an agent that greps its offloaded
results then only ever sees its OWN session's results, not a global pile of every
session's history. A flat global store (which this used to be) grew unbounded —
to 5GB across weeks — and a subagent grepping it re-matched its own + historical
outputs forever, never converging. `prune_offload_store` bounds growth by age so
it can't accumulate again. Long-term raw evidence is stored separately via
core.raw_tool_results and the tool_results manifest.

tool_call_ids are globally unique, so `find_result_file` can still locate a file
from the id alone (glob across session dirs) for layers that don't carry the
session — e.g. the context-budget middleware rewriting an older result to a stub.
