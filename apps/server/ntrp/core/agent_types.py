# with a prompt that rides along. This is the shape the research subagent already
# used by hand (read-only base − spawn tools + its ledger tools); both the
# workflow agent() combinator and research() now resolve from this one registry
# instead of each assembling a toolset inline.
#
#   actions  capability: a set of allowed ToolActions, or None for all.
#            {READ} is a read-only analyst; None is a builder that writes/executes.
#   exclude  tool names removed on top of the capability filter.
#   extra_tools  specialized tools injected for this type (research's ledger).
#   prompt   static persona prompt; None means the caller supplies it (research's
#            prompt is rendered per-call from depth + live ledger).
#
# Invocation concerns (isolation, wait, compaction handoff, model) are NOT here —
# they are set at the spawn site, because they are not part of "what tools this
# kind of agent has."
