"""run_memory_init (ntrp/memory/init.py) — the /init full re-derivation driver.

Phase 1 = TRANSCRIPTS ONLY. Hermetic: a STUB curator LLM (scripted single-call
JSON ops, reusing the test_memory_curator pattern), a STUB consolidate LLM (empty
ops so the sweep no-ops but still advances its watermark), a STUB sessions store,
and a real tmp RecordStore (`search_index=None` -> FTS-only). The whole memory
lives in a tmp sqlite so ~/.ntrp is never touched.

Proves:
  (a) the PINNED record survives the wipe;
  (b) the 3 non-pinned records are gone;
  (c) curate_watermark:%/consolidate_watermark meta rows were cleared then re-written;
  (d) >=1 record was re-derived from the seeded chat session;
  (e) the backup file exists at the returned backup_path;
  (f) the report counts are right.
