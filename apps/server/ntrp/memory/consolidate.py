"""Consolidate/Lint — the background pass that turns the raw record pile into a
SMALL, CLEAN, CURRENT body. THIS is the memory: records alone are raw and uncurated.

A periodic health-check of the active record pool. The only stage that removes
records from circulation: MERGE duplicates onto one survivor, SUPERSEDE
stale/contradicted records into a newer one, DROP genuine orphans. It never
authors a new fact and never raises trust. Each sweep also runs ONE bounded
label-hygiene call over the whole label vocabulary, folding near-duplicate
names (case/synonym variants) via rename_label.

Demote/merge-only. Candidate selection scans the active durable pool, but each
record's recall neighborhood is judged (one cheap LLM call) only when its content
fingerprint CHANGED since its last clean judge — cached in the consolidate meta DB.
So a clean night is nearly free and cost scales with what changed, not the corpus
size. Pinned records are inviolable. With no LLM configured, the pass is a no-op.

Adapted from the deleted claim-pipeline `consolidate.py`: scopes,
provenance/feedback/corroboration ordering, CONTRADICTS/SUPERSEDES edges, and the
high-trust flag path are all stripped — records are flat, edge-less, single-axis.
