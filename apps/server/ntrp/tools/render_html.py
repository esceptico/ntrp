RENDER_HTML_DESCRIPTION = """Render an HTML widget as a rich card in the chat.

The HTML must be fully self-contained: inline all CSS and JavaScript. The widget runs in a sandboxed iframe with a strict Content-Security-Policy — external scripts, stylesheets, images, fonts, fetch/XHR, form submissions to URLs, and link navigation are all blocked or swallowed; assume the widget has no network access. Images must be data: URIs. Do not include links or form actions pointing at external URLs — they will not work.

The host renders your HTML inside a card that already has a border, rounded corners, padding, a background, and a header showing the title — do NOT draw your own outer container: no wrapper panel with border/border-radius/box-shadow/background, no repeating the title as a heading. Start directly with content (controls, table, chart, prose) and let it fill 100% of the available width.

Theming: the host injects the app's design tokens as CSS variables on :root — use them so the widget matches the app. Available: --color-bg, --color-surface, --color-surface-soft, --color-line, --color-line-soft, --color-ink, --color-ink-soft, --color-muted, --color-faint, --color-accent, --color-accent-soft, --color-ok, --color-warn, --color-bad, --font-sans, --font-mono. The body already has comfortable padding, the app font, and a transparent background.

A base stylesheet is provided — prefer plain semantic HTML over custom CSS: headings, p, a, table, code/pre, hr, label, input, select, textarea, button (button.primary for the main action) are all pre-styled to match the app. Utility classes: .field (label + control block), .grid-2 (two-column grid), .chip (bordered checkbox/radio label that highlights when checked), .actions (right-aligned footer row for buttons), .muted (secondary text). Write custom CSS only for bespoke visuals (charts, diagrams, custom layouts).

For forms, ntrp.submitForm(form) collects every named field (FormData semantics: checkbox groups sharing a name become arrays) and submits it — e.g. <form onsubmit="ntrp.submitForm(this); return false"> with named inputs needs no other JavaScript.

mode="display": returns immediately. Use for charts, tables, visualizations, and self-contained interactive content. Nothing the user does in the widget comes back to you.

mode="input": BLOCKS until the user responds (or times out after a few minutes). Build a form or controls and call ntrp.submit({...}) exactly once with a flat JSON object of the collected values, e.g. ntrp.submit({rating: 4, comment: "fine"}). Optionally include a dismiss control that calls ntrp.cancel(). The tool result is a JSON string {"action": "accept" | "decline" | "cancel", "values": {...}} — "accept" means the user submitted (read values), "decline" means the user explicitly declined, "cancel" means dismissed or timed out (values is empty for both). Requires an interactive client: in background agents and automation runs, mode="input" fails immediately — use mode="display" or plain text instead."""
